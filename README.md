# Deep Learning for Sequential Recommendation: Algorithms, Influential Factors, and Evaluations
Here is the code and datasets to reproduce the experiment result in the paper "Deep Learning for Sequential Recommendation: Algorithms, InfluentialFactors, and Evaluations"
# Code
- **GRU4Rec** is the code to reproduce the result of basic GRU4Rec, sample size, sample alpha, loss function and data augmentation. 
- **GRU4Rec-with-dwell-time** is the code to reproduce the result of Dwell time.
- **GRU4Rec-with-knn** is the code to reproduce the result of KNN.
- **category-and-behavior** is the code to reproduce the result of P-GRU, C-GRU and B-GRU, GRU4Rec(behavior) and GRU4Rec(category).
- **attention-mechanism** is the code to reproduce the result of Attention mechanism.
- **user** is the code to reproduce the result of user representation(implicit, embedded and recurrent).
- **data_preprocess** is the preprocessing code for each dataset.
